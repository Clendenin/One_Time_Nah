* **(Optional) Tools Required / Used:**

## Steps
#### Step 1
The prompt gives you 3 encrypted messages in binary form. The title combined with the knowledge of these 3 messages will hopefully lead you to the one time pad cipher. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad

### Step 2
The wikipedia page mentions that the one time pad "is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked"; however if misused, or should I say reused, the encryption is easly cracked. One time pad encryption is built on XORing the plain text with a private key to obtain the cipher text. Try using http://xor.pw/# to xor the messages together in some combination to undo this process.
